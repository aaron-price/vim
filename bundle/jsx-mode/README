### What is JSX Mode?
It's almost a sub-mode of :normal where many of the usual movement keys have been remapped to work with JSX (Or any xml) easier.
Also comes with some tools for generating boilerplate nobody likes.

#### Tags
this
parent
child
sibling

#### tag elements
definition
attributes
content

#### actions
change
make
delete
yank
put


in jsx-mode you always have either a current tag or it will jump back to normal mode.
every tag has a parent (root tag's parent is itself)
tags can be self closing
tags can have child Tags
the current tag is highlighted

A tag is composed of the definition (div, p, h1, etc), the attributes (className, src, etc) and the inside (content between tags).
You can GO to any element of the current tag like so:
gd: go to definition
ga: go to attributes
gi: go to inside
gI: go to end of inside
go: go just after closing tag
gO: go just before opening tag
gc: go to first child Tag
g5c: go to the fifth child Tag
gp: go to the parent Tag
g5p: go to the great-great-great-great-grandparent tag

You can do other actions too. 
cd: change definition (takes input, then updates both opening and closing tag if possible)
y2c: yank second child Tag
dt: delete this tag
fspan: goes to the next span tag
w: goes to the next inside
b: goes to the previous inside


" Misc boilerplate
<leader>//  comments or uncomments tag
<leader>bind takes input then binds it to current component. Inserts text at cursor.
<leader>comp // Asks a few questions and generates a component
